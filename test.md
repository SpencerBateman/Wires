#### Notes
This user was distracted early by the synthesizer itself and didn’t read the text at the top of the page. It is important to add a progression at the top of the page to make it clear what is going on.

#### Feedback
I feel like it would be more clear if there were waveforms on the buttons. That visualization is important for me to be able to see.
